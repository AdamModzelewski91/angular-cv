  "ABOUT_ME": "I started my adventure with frontend in 2021, where at the beginning it was my new hobby and fascination with creating simple websites and learning HTML, CSS and JS. When I mastered the basics to a good level, I decided that I would like to deal with this on a daily basis at work, because it gives me a lot of pleasure. This is how I also started learning React to be able to meet recruitment expectations. In March 2022, I managed to get an internship at Inetum as a Frontend developer, where I was dealing with AngularJS. The project ended quite quickly, I was promoted to junior and from June I was in another project, where I am dealing with modern Angular (+13). What I can say about myself is that I am hardworking, precise and friendly. I really like to learn and constantly develop my skills and I am open to new experiences.",

The application was written in AngularJS using TypeScript and was divided into microservices. The changes concerned 2 microservices, the main one (CMS) and the survey (for the client). The main tasks in the project were the implementation of new functionalities and the development of old ones to meet business requirements.",
